# 30 Teams and 3 players
This is a small ipython notebook in which we pull data from baseball references.com and figure out if there are any three combination of players that have played on all thirty franchises. It pull from a list that contains the 250ish most "mobile" players, who have played with up to 8 franchises. We demonstrate that the largest combination in this list has 27 franchises, but this could be higher if the player list went down to 7 or 6 franchise players.
